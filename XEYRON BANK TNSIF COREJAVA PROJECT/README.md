## 🐬 MySQL Installation & Setup

#### 1️⃣ Install MySQL

If you don’t have MySQL installed:

- Download: [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

#### 2️⃣ Create Database

1. Create a database:
    CREATE DATABASE bankingsystemdb;

2. To avoid connection errors during initial setup, edit your DatabaseManager.java file to use your MySQL root credentials instead:
          conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
            "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bankingsystemdb",
            "root", // change this to your MySQL root username
            "your_root_password" // change this to your MySQL root password
          );

3. Table Creation
    Once you run the main Java file (ConsoleApp.java), it will automatically be created.
